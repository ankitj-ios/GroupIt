# Project - *GroupIt*


### Problem

Managing day-to-day tasks within groups is a tough problem. Multiple platforms exist today that are focussed on solving specific task.

### Solution

Our solution is trying to solve above problem by reversing the way we thing today. Today, we have multiple platforms and within each platform, we create group. However, with **GroupIt**, we will create groups and then pick the tasks we want to use this group for using the pre-defined set of category templates.
